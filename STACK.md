To build my stack, I went to drupalvm.com and cloned the repository found there. I cdâ€™d into the cloned repo using the terminal and did git branch --all to display all branches. I switched to the Drupal 7 branch since the master branch is set to D8. I made copies of the config.yml and drupal.make.yml files and ensured they were set to Drupal 7 instead of 8. After that, I ran vagrant up in the terminal and then edited my host files so that I could connect to the VM. Lastly, I went to http://drupalvm.dev/ and logged on to my local site.
