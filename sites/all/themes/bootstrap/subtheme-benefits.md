Why would you want to create a sub-theme as opposed to starting from scratch?


By starting from scratch, you will have to rewrite the considerable functionality that already comes with sub-themes. Sub-themes are usually browser tested by a community of users. When starting from scratch, you will face challenges integrating your HTML and CSS with the Drupal CMS and you might face bugs that have been solved before. Additionally, you will not be able to use the benefits of sub-themes such as overriding and editing existing templates and functions.
